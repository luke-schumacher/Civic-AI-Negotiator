**Using DEBATING LLMs to Reduce Bias: A Deliberative Approach to AI-Assisted Civic Decision-Making**

A research-based platform that presents civic issues through debates between two AI agents rather than a single chatbot, promoting balanced deliberation and reducing algorithmic bias in democratic participation.

Co-developed for the course Civig Engagement as part of the Artificial Inteligence for Sustainable Socieities (AISS) program.
